## IMPROTANT IMPLEMENTATION PRINCIPLES

These are the most important rules that must be followed in all implementations:

### Implement only the absolute minimum necessary

- Add only essential functionality
- Avoid over-engineering or adding "nice-to-have" features
- Focus on solving the specific problem at hand

### Minimize changes to existing functionality and code

- Preserve existing working code whenever possible
- Use extension patterns rather than modification
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Only change existing code when absolutely necessary

## Abbreviations

UST = Use Sequential Thinking (MCP)
UBS = Use Brave Search (MCP)

- Check the diff using git commands.
